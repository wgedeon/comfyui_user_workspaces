## 👨‍💻 For Node Developers

### Workspace Consumer

Declare your node as a workspace consumer, and add the corresponding input:

python:
```python
class MyCustomNode:
    @classmethod
    def INPUT_TYPES(cls):
        ui_features = {
            "is_workspace_consumer": {},
            "is_workspace_producer": {}  # Optional for chaining functionality
        }
        return {
            "required": {
                "workspace": ("WORKSPACE",),
            },
            "hidden": {
                "ui_features": ("STRING", {"default": json.dumps(ui_features)}),
            }
        }

    def process(self, workspace):
        # Access workspace properties
        height = workspace.full_path
        width = workspace.width
        height = workspace.height

# ...
```

### UI Real-Time Updates with Callbacks

javascript:
```javascript
app.registerExtension({
    nodeType.prototype.onNodeCreated = function () {
        this.onWorkspaceUpdated = async (node) => {
            console.log("Workspace updated - refreshing UI");
            // refresh something based on the updated workspace info
        }
    }
});
```

### 🎯 Best Practices

* ✅ Always include ui_features for proper integration

* ✅ Handle optional workspace inputs gracefully

* ✅ Use real-time updates for dynamic UI

* ✅ Clean up resources on workspace changes

* ✅ Provide fallback behavior when no workspace
